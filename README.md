Pas' .vimrc, .bashrc, .inputrc, and maybe more!

## Vim

For Vim you should use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle/), and just
clone it into .vim/bundle/. It's sourced from bundles.vim. And then start vim
and type :BundleInstall and hit enter.

Better yet, follow Zaiste's guidance and use the remarkable framework of
scripts. [Vimified](https://zaiste.github.com/vimified/).

## Bash

Don't forget to install bash-completion!
