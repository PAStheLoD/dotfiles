Pas' .vimrc, .bashrc, .inputrc, and maybe more!

=== Vim ===

For Vim you should use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle/), and just
clone it into .vim/bundles. It's sourced from bundles.vim. And then start vim
and type :BundleInstall and hit enter.

=== Bash ===

Don't forget to install bash-completion!
